      <p>
        On November 3, the general election will decide the next American
        president. The candidates in the race are Former Vice President Joe
        Biden (the Democratic nominee) and incumbent president Donald Trump (the
        Republican nominee). Amidst the pandemic and ample social change, the
        nation has never been more polarized by two presidential candidates. As
        the two political sides shift farther away from one another, Democrats
        and Republicans fight for the promotion of their views. Recently, the
        candidates faced off in a live debate for the nation and Trump shortly
        after became diagnosed with COVID-19. Since then, there have been no
        further debates between the two candidates, though their vice
        presidential picks (Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Mike Pence)
        faced off last week.
