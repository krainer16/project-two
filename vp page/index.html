            Harris once supported the Green New Deal with Senator Bernie
            Sanders, but she recently has shifted her position to promote
            Biden's climate plan, which requires the American government to
            re-join the Paris Climate agreement and hopes to reduce U.S. carbon
            emissions significantly. In contrast, Pence used to promote the
            philosophy that climate change is a myth, but he has since altered
            his stance to support the idea that human activity does influence
            climate change in some way.

            Pence has headed the White House Coronavirus Task Force since
            February and continues to vary his stance on the severity of the
            pandemic, but he has been working to decrease the number of cases in
            the United States. Harris, on the other hand, continues to condemn
            the way that Pence and Trump have tackled the pandemic, promoting
            the idea that she has Biden will enforce stricter regulations to
            bend the curve.

            Pence is a strong supporter of police forces, backing Trump's notion
            of law and order and disagreeing with efforts to defund the police.
            Harris, however, supports economic and educational improvements to
            minority communities to help combat police brutality.

          <div class="answer">
            Harris supports the expansion of health care access for American
            citizens, while also preserving private health insurance. Pence, in
            contrast, supports Trump's goal to revoke Obamacare and turn over
            the efforts of the Obama-Biden administration, essentially defunding
            public healthcare.

            Pence is a public advocate of the second amendment and the National
            Rifle Association, opposing potential restrictions and condemning
            gun control efforts. Harris, on the other hand, proposes reforms to
            counter gun violence by creating bans on assault weapons and
            expanding background checks.
