          On November 3, the general election will decide the next American
          president. The candidates in the race are Former Vice President Joe
          Biden (the Democratic nominee) and incumbent president Donald Trump
          (the Republican nominee). Amidst the pandemic and ample social change,
          the nation has never been more polarized by two presidential
          candidates. As the two political sides shift farther away from one
          another, Democrats and Republicans fight for the promotion of their
          views. Recently, the candidates faced off in a live debate for the
          nation and Trump shortly after became diagnosed with COVID-19. Since
          then, there have been no further debates between the two candidates,
          though their vice presidential picks (Democrat Kamala Harris and
          Republican Mike Pence) faced off last week.
