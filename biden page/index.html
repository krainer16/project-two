      <h4>Joe Biden: Who He Is and What He Stands For</h4>
    </div>
  </head>

  <div class="boxed">
    <p>
      Mr. Biden, who has served in public life for around a half-century, is
      emphasizing his government experience, seeking to cast himself as a
      steady, seasoned hand in a dangerous and uncertain world.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the coronavirus crisis has unfolded, he has looked for ways to help
      voters picture him as commander in chief, formulating recommendations
      rooted in advice from health care and economics experts. Those suggestions
      include making coronavirus tests broadly accessible, and free. He has said
      there should be no out-of-pocket cost for patients to receive an eventual
      vaccine, either. And he has been sharply critical of President Trump’s
      response to the virus, accusing him of reacting too slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Biden served as vice president in the Obama administration during the
      passage of the Affordable Care Act, and health care remains a top priority
      for him. It’s an issue he often discusses in the context of his family’s
      personal tragedies: He lost his first wife and an infant daughter in a car
      accident in 1972, and in 2015, his son Beau Biden died of brain cancer.
      Health care, he said in an early television ad, is “personal” to him. He
      supports adding a public option to the Affordable Care Act, but opposes
      “Medicare for all,” the sweeping single-payer measure advocated by some
      progressives in his party, including Senator Bernie Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Biden, who served for decades in the Senate, firmly believes in the
      value of bipartisanship and insists on extending overtures to Republicans
      even in a moment when many in his own party don’t see negotiating partners
      on the other side. As a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
      Committee, he also speaks passionately about asserting and defending
      America’s role as a leader on the global stage.

      <b>Would Joe Biden be the oldest president in history?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. He would be the oldest president in history at his inauguration, at
      age 78. Mr. Trump, who is currently 74, would also be the oldest president
      ever if he wins a second term.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Where is Joe Biden from?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Biden was born in Scranton, Pa., in 1942, and moved to Delaware as a
      child. As a politician, he has maintained close political ties to both
      states, though Mr. Trump has accused Mr. Biden of having “deserted”
      Pennsylvania.
    </p>
    <p>“I was in third grade,” Mr. Biden shot back.</p>
    <p>
      He continues to maintain strong ties to Pennsylvania, a critical general
      election battleground that Mr. Trump won in 2016, and he has based his
      campaign headquarters in Philadelphia.
